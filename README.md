- **Calendar** - Date dimension table
- **Products** - Product master data
- **Customers** - Customer information
- **Regions** - Saudi Arabian regions

### Key Relationships

- SalesData_SA[Customer ID] ↔ Customers[Customer ID]

## 📐 DAX Formulas

### Core Measures

```dax
Total Sales Excl VAT = SUM(SalesData_SA[Total Sales Excl VAT])

Total Profit = SUM(SalesData_SA[Total Profit])

Profit Margin % = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Profit],
    [Total Sales Excl VAT],
    0
)

Average Order Value = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Sales Excl VAT],
    DISTINCTCOUNT(SalesData_SA[Order ID]),
    0
)
```

### Advanced Measures

```dax
Avg Orders per Customer = 
DIVIDE(
    COUNTROWS(SalesData_SA),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(SalesData_SA[Customer ID]),
    0
)

Simulated Profit = 
VAR DiscountRate = SELECTEDVALUE('Discount Scenario'[Discount Rate], 0)
VAR AdjustedRevenue = [Total Sales Excl VAT] * (1 - DiscountRate)
VAR TotalCost = SUM(SalesData_SA[Unit Cost]) * SUM(SalesData_SA[Quantity])
RETURN
    AdjustedRevenue - TotalCost
```
